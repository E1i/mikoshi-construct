The policies the presets ship were shape matches on one spelling each, and the same operation written another way walked past: `await import('@scope/shared')`, `const { env } = process`, `globalThis.process.env`, `const { body } = req`, and — worst of the set — ``sql.raw`select 1` ``, the tagged form that `NO_RAW_SQL`'s own message tells you to use. Each restriction in the monorepo and node-backend presets now covers its class, including binding `process` or `req` to a local name, while keeping every role's exemptions exactly as they were.

The durable half is the test. `syntax-policy.test.ts` compared resolved selector strings against the same strings restated in the test — proof that a restriction is attached, never that it fires. Both presets now lint real source per role from a single per-role table: one sample per restricted form expecting a report, each role's exempt forms expecting none.

Named limit: in the monorepo, a package that binds `process` to a local name and reads `.env` off it is still not reported. That restriction is env-specific by design, and widening it would change what the rule means rather than what it catches.
