`construct cost` stops reporting two different facts as one. A missing project directory meant both "this runtime does not expose per-run usage" and "nothing has been run here yet", and the command printed the more damning reading of the two — so a Cursor user was told nothing was recorded when the truth was that their runtime never records it. Behind a `CostSource` interface, the command now resolves the runtime it is actually running under and answers `ok`, `empty`, `unsupported`, `mismatch` or `unknown`, each with its own exit code and its own line. `--json` is an object carrying the status, the runtime and the project key that was looked up. A key that misses because the repository was reached through a worktree, a symlink or another path is named as such instead of being reported as absence, and where the evidence does not settle it the answer is `unknown` rather than a guess.
